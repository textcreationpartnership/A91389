            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe Petitioners are duely and deeply ſenſible of the great miſeries of their Brethren in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of the eminent danger, not onely of the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall loſſe of that Kingdome, but of the ruine of this alſo, if that of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould (which God forbid) be loſt. And as they have hitherto ſhewed themſelves ready, even beyond their abilities to ſerve the King and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> ſo ſhall they ever continue to the utmoſt of their power, with all cheerefulnes and duty. But at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they are compelled to repeat their former <hi>Anſwer;</hi> That they have no power to raiſe any Summes by way of Tax for any forreigne uſe; and doe further anſwer that they have no meanes to doe it, otherwiſe then by the immediate perſonall Conſent of every particular Lender, which they cannot hope to obtaine in regard of theſe obſtructions following: Which the Petitioners humbly preſent, together with this their further An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, as the Reaſons thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That immediately before the <hi>Parliament</hi> and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence divers great Summes for the ſervice of the King and Kingdome have beene already lent by the Citizens
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:157562:4"/>

                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> for the ſupply of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in particular; a great part whereof ſome of the Lenders were compelled to borrow, and cannot to this day repay.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſuch part of thoſe moneyes as are already due to the Citizens from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and ſhould have bin repaid out of the <hi>Pole-moneyes</hi> and <hi>Subſidies,</hi> is not yet done, becauſe there is not any conſiderable ſumme come in from the Countrey as was expected to ſatisfie the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the ſaid 50000 <abbr>l.</abbr> lent for <hi>Ireland</hi> was haſtened and ſpeedily paid within neare about 2000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l</hi>
                  </abbr> upon this ground then urged by the <hi>Parliament;</hi> that if it were forth with lent, it might be of more uſe to preſerve that Kingdome then the lone of 200000 <abbr>l.</abbr> could be, if defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but ſix Weeks; yet no conſiderable Forces are ſent thither to this day. And we find that men will not be willing to lend any thing till they be aſſured that a good ſtrength be ſent thither with full Commiſſion to relieve <hi>London Derry</hi> and other parts of that Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The generall withholding of very great Summes of money from the Petitioners, and many others, which moneys have beene long due, not onely from <hi>Chapmen</hi> and other debtors in <hi>England;</hi> but from very many in <hi>Ireland</hi> (who owe many hundred Thouſands of Pounds to the Citizens of <hi>London</hi>) doth render divers perſons of good, Eſtates and credit hardly able to goe on with Trade; or to pay their debts and maintain their Charge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Brotherly offer of <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſend 10000 men into <hi>Jreland,</hi> not yet ſo accepted as to produce any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe to that bleeding Kingdome, while yet our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are dayly maſſacred there, diſcourageth moſt men from lending any Money, were they never ſo able.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 131 -->
               <p n="6">6. The not paſſing the Bil for preſſing of ſoldiers here, whereby ſuch forces as are requiſit might be timely ſent from hence into <hi>Ireland,</hi> puts many men into feares, that there may be ſome deſigne rather to loſe that Kingdom, and to conſume this in the loſing of <hi>Ireland,</hi> than to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve either the one or the other; for that it cannot be conceived, that the Rebells (being growne ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) will be ſuppreſſed by volunteires.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſlow iſſuing of Commiſſions to thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or going thither, are willing to enter the field againſt the Rebells, diſables them from doing any effectuall execution upon the enemy, unleſſe in their owne defence; and ſo all the monies that have beene, or may be ſent thither, are exhauſted to maintaine our forces to doe little or nothing worthy of them, rather then imployed to chaſtiſe the Rebells, and to reduce them to obedience, by meanes whereof the number and power of the Rebels are greatly encreaſed, divers caſtles and townes are by them taken, much Proteſtant blood is daily ſpilt, many thouſand families deſtroyed, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant part of Papiſts and their adherents here are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and thoſe Rebells ſo much inboldened, that they boaſt, they will extirpate the Britiſh Nation there, and then make <hi>England</hi> the ſeat of warre.</p>
